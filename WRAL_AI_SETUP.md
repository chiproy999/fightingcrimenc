### Example: Before vs After AI Rewriting

**ORIGINAL (from WRAL):**
> "Man charged in deadly Durham hit-and-run was in country illegally. ICE confirmed Wilmer Fuentes Mejia is in the country illegally. Mejia was charged with hit-and-run and involuntary manslaughter in connection with a deadly crash in Durham in September."

**AI REWRITTEN (Claude):**
> "Durham authorities have arrested and charged a man in connection with a fatal hit-and-run crash that occurred in September, according to WRAL News. Wilmer Fuentes Mejia now faces serious charges including hit-and-run and involuntary manslaughter. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials confirmed that Mejia is unlawfully present in the United States. The incident remains under investigation by Durham Police Department as they work to provide justice for the victim's family."

**Difference:**
- ‚úÖ Original facts preserved
- ‚úÖ Professional journalistic tone

- ‚úÖ Unique content (no plagiarism)
- ‚úÖ Added context and flow
