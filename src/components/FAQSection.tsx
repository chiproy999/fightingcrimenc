      answer: "Use the official County Tip Directory at fightingcrimenc.com/county-resources to reach the correct law enforcement portal for your area. Fighting Crime NC does not collect or store tipsâ€”everything goes directly to verified government agencies. For emergencies or crimes in progress, always call 911."
    },

      question: "What counties does Fighting Crime NC cover?",
      answer: "Fighting Crime NC provides comprehensive coverage of all 100 North Carolina counties, from the mountains to the coast. We aggregate real-time crime news, wanted persons alerts, and missing person information from law enforcement agencies across the entire state, giving you statewide visibility unlike regional-only crime sites."
    },
    {
      question: "How often is the wanted persons database updated?",
      answer: "Our wanted persons database is updated in real-time as law enforcement agencies across North Carolina report new cases. We pull from 15+ official RSS feeds from major police departments, sheriff offices, and state agencies including Charlotte-Mecklenburg PD, Raleigh PD, Durham PD, NC State Highway Patrol, and the NC Department of Public Safety."
    },
    {

We aggregate RSS feeds from verified police departments, sheriff offices, and state agencies. We do not publish unverified information or rumors. Every alert includes the source agency for transparency."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I report a sighting of a wanted person or missing person?",
      answer: "If you see a wanted person or missing individual, DO NOT approach them. Call 911 immediately if there is any threat to safety. For non-emergency tips, use the County Tip Directory to reach the law enforcement agency handling the case so your information goes straight to investigators."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Fighting Crime NC affiliated with law enforcement?",

      answer: "Currently, we provide real-time crime news through our website covering all 100 NC counties. Visit our Crime News page for the latest updates, or bookmark fightingcrimenc.com to check daily. We're working on adding email and SMS alert subscriptions for specific counties and cities."
    },
    {
