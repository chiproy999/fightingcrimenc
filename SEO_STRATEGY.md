## üéØ KEYWORD STRATEGY TO OUTRANK THEM

### Primary Keywords (High Volume)
Target these BEFORE they do:

1. **"North Carolina crime news"** (their main keyword)
   - Your advantage: Statewide vs 4 counties

2. **"NC wanted persons"** (HIGH VALUE)
   - Create county-specific pages later

3. **"North Carolina missing persons"**
   - Amber alerts, Silver alerts = high traffic

4. **"NC crime alerts"** / **"NC public safety"**
   - They don't target these well

5. **"[City] NC crime news"** for EVERY major city:
   - Charlotte crime news
   - Raleigh crime news
   - Durham crime news
   - Greensboro crime news
   - (They only have 4 cities, you have 100+ counties!)

### Long-Tail Keywords (Easy Wins)
1. "real-time NC crime alerts"
2. "North Carolina law enforcement news"
3. "submit anonymous crime tip NC"
4. "NC sheriffs department news"
5. "North Carolina safety alerts"

### Location-Based Keywords (DOMINATE THEM)
Create content for:
- Every NC county + "crime news"
- Every major city + "wanted persons"
- Every major city + "missing persons"

**Example**: "Wake County crime news", "Mecklenburg County wanted persons", etc.
